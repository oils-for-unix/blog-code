TODO
----

- Add more unit tests
  - output should be "clamped" with self.f instead of sys.stdout?

Fixed
-----

- FIXED make sure it works in non-fancy mode, without color, for libedit and for
  impoverished displays

- prompt should move properly with Oil style
  - it has an issue because there are two lines

- FIXED Hitting tab on the SECOND word of the SECOND line.  Cursor goes to the
  wrong place.
  - had to take PS2 length into account

- Needs shell-escaping for quoting filenames
  - add that to demoish or do it in OSH?
