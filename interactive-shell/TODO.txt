TODO
----

- start integrating:
  - core/display.py instead of ui.py?  Just to copy it right over
  - flag for --style oil|osh|basic ?
    - yeah I kind of want the oil style prompt.  But isn't that totally
      independent from completion?

- comp_state has ORIG, prefix_pos, and DESC
  - need to hook this up i Oil
- termios deps and so forth -- move to libc? 


- clamp super long filenames to like 30 characters?
  - bash and zsh do NOT do this, but I think it's reasonable for the
    NiceDisplay?
  - params:
    - max lines (num_lines_cap)
    - max width per candidate


- TODO: test what zsh does when there is a super long candidate
  - hm zsh seems to do better
  - it knows where it is on the line
  - maybe punt this until later.

Integration Issues
------------------

- Ctrl_C  Ctrl_D  Empty  Node(command c) -- 
  - yes the line reader should return these!
  - so the main loop can handle them
  - no the command parser would have to handle them.  Exceptions are better.
  - I think you have use Python for now, but write C++ code later to figure out
    how they can be handled


- RootCompleter also gets DESCRIPTIONS!
  - there is a 2-tuple.  Have to figure that interface.

- are you generating too much garbage here?  rebuilding a new dictionary every
  time?
  - also: how are you going to get descriptions into OSH?
    - you could dynamically run awk I guess 
    - or you could make up a better file format
  - this is an interesting case for arena allocation
    - you don't want to COPY strings
    - but the dictionary is ephemeral, and you don't want ephemeral copies for
      every completion candidate?

- are you going to hook up both OSH and Oil style?

Fixed
-----

- FIXED make sure it works in non-fancy mode, without color, for libedit and for
  impoverished displays

- prompt should move properly with Oil style
  - it has an issue because there are two lines

- FIXED Hitting tab on the SECOND word of the SECOND line.  Cursor goes to the
  wrong place.
  - had to take PS2 length into account

- Needs shell-escaping for quoting filenames
  - add that to demoish or do it in OSH?


- DONE PrintRequired vs. PrintOptioanl
  - for BasicDisplay
    - but then it has to redisplay the prompt?
    - I think that is OK.  It will help people learn how to use it?



- Add more unit tests
  - output should be "clamped" with self.f instead of sys.stdout?

- Test what happens when you exceed terminal width
  - maybe have a debug-print of terminal width state!
  - you can't avoid it when the user is typing
    - it gets screwed up
    - I'm not sure if we can avoid this
  - could you DETECT when prompt_len + orig_len is greater than max_width
    - and then fallback on BASIC display?
    - that means it's kind of dynamic?
  - max_match_len could be greater than term_width!
    - test what in PrintPacked
