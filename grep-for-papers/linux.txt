   12  * It instruments the kernel code inserting stackleak_track_stack() calls:
   13  *  - after alloca();
   14  *  - for the functions with a stack frame size greater than or equal
   15  *     to the "track-min-size" plugin parameter.

include/linux/reciprocal_div.h

    8  * This algorithm is based on the paper "Division by Invariant
    9  * Integers Using Multiplication" by TorbjÃ¶rn Granlund and Peter
   10  * L. Montgomery.
   11  *
   12  * The assembler implementation from Agner Fog, which this code is
   13  * based on, can be found here:
   14  * http://www.agner.org/optimize/asmlib.zip
   15  *
   16  * This optimization for A/B is helpful if the divisor B is mostly
   17  * runtime invariant. The reciprocal of B is calculated in the
   18  * slow-path with reciprocal_value(). The fast-path can then just use
   19  * a much faster multiplication operation with a variable dividend A
   20  * to calculate the division A/B.

  100  * ones that guarantee a low latency to interactive and soft real-time
  101  * applications, and a hierarchical extension based on H-WF2Q+.

  103  * B-WF2Q+ is based on WF2Q+, which is described in [2], together with
  104  * H-WF2Q+, while the augmented tree used here to implement B-WF2Q+

   22  *
   23  *   Note: Since Boyer-Moore (BM) performs searches for matchings from right 
   24  *   to left, it's still possible that a matching could be spread over 
   25  *   multiple blocks, in that case this algorithm won't find any coincidence.
   26  *   
   27  *   If you're willing to ensure that such thing won't ever happen, use the
   28  *   Knuth-Pratt-Morris (KMP) implementation instead. In conclusion, choose 
   29  *   the proper string search algorithm depending on your setting. 
   30  *
   31  *   Say you're using the textsearch infrastructure for filtering, NIDS or 
   32  *   any similar security focused purpose, then go KMP. Otherwise, if you 
   33  *   really care about performance, say you're classifying packets to apply

    2  * SpanDSP - a series of DSP components for telephony
    3  *
    4  * echo.c - A line echo canceller.  This code is being developed
    5  *          against and partially complies with G168.

   32 Line echo cancellation for voice
   33 
   34 What does it do?
   35 
   36 This module aims to provide G.168-2002 compliant echo cancellation, to remove
   37 electrical echoes (e.g. from 2-4 wire hybrids) from voice calls.
   38 
   39 How does it work?
   40 
   41 The heart of the echo cancellor is FIR filter. This is adapted to match the
   42 echo impulse response of the telephone line. It must be long enough to
   43 adequately cover the duration of that impulse response. The signal transmitted
   44 to the telephone line is passed through the FIR filter. Once the FIR is
   45 properly adapted, the resulting output is an estimate of the echo signal
   46 received from the line. This is subtracted from the received signal. The result
   47 is an estimate of the signal which originated at the far end of the line, free
   48 from echos of our own transmitted signal.
   49 
   50 The least mean squares (LMS) algorithm is attributed to Widrow and Hoff, and
   51 was introduced in 1960. It is the commonest form of filter adaption used in
   52 things like modem line equalisers and line echo cancellers. There it works very
   53 well.  However, it only works well for signals of constant amplitude. It works
   54 very poorly for things like speech echo cancellation, where the signal level
   55 varies widely.  This is quite easy to fix. If the signal level is normalised -
   56 similar to applying AGC - LMS can work as well for a signal of varying
   57 amplitude as it does for a modem signal. This normalised least mean squares
   58 (NLMS) algorithm is the commonest one used for speech echo cancellation. Many
   59 other algorithms exist - e.g. RLS (essentially the same as Kalman filtering),
   60 FAP, etc. Some perform significantly better than NLMS.  However, factors such
   61 as computational complexity and patents favour the use of NLMS.

   13  *      Each code tree is stored in a compressed form which is itself
   14  * a Huffman encoding of the lengths of all the code strings (in

   17  * in the deflate specification.

lib/zlib_deflate/deflate.c

    2 /* deflate.c -- compress data using the deflation algorithm

   10  *      The "deflation" process depends on being able to identify portions
   11  *      of the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a
   12  *      sliding window trailing behind the input currently being processed).
   13  *
   14  *      The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
   15  *      most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
   16  *      The key feature of this algorithm is that insertions into the string
   17  *      dictionary are very simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided
   18  *      completely. Insertions are performed at each input character, whereas
   19  *      string matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it
   20  *      is preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
   21  *      insertions and avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small
   22  *      strings is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach
   23  *      is used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
   24  *      A similar algorithm is used in comic (by Jan-Mark Wams) and freeze
   25  *      (by Leonid Broukhis).
   26  *         A previous version of this file used a more sophisticated algorithm
   27  *      (by Fiala and Greene) which is guaranteed to run in linear amortized
   28  *      time, but has a larger average cost, uses more memory and is patented.
   29  *      However the F&G algorithm may be faster for some highly redundant
   30  *      files if the parameter max_chain_length (described below) is too large.
   31  *
   32  *  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
   33  *
   34  *      The idea of lazy evaluation of matches is due to Jan-Mark Wams, and
   35  *      I found it in 'freeze' written by Leonid Broukhis.
   36  *      Thanks to many people for bug reports and testing.

   32  *  3) All leaves (NULL) are black
   33  *  4) Both children of every red node are black
   34  *  5) Every simple path from root to leaves contains the same number
   35  *     of black nodes.
   36  *
   37  *  4 and 5 give the O(log n) guarantee, since 4 implies you cannot have two
   38  *  consecutive red nodes in a path and every red node is therefore followed by
   39  *  a black. So if B is the number of black nodes on every simple path (as per
   40  *  5), then the longest possible path due to 4 is 2B.

   43  *  nodes will be lowercase. Unknown color nodes shall be drawn as red within
