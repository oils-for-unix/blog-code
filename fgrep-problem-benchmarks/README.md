# fgrep-problem-benchmarks

The "fgrep problem" is to match a set of fixed strings in a corpus.  The
matching can be done "in parallel" by a DFA.

There are various methods to generate the DFA.

See the top of `fixed-strings.sh` for instructions on running these benchmarks.

## Visualization

Simple DFA for `"do" | "done" | "break"`.  See below for the DFA for the bigger
benchmark problem.

Note that there are ~35 states `yy2` - `yy36`.

  `GrepFixedStrings()` is compiled to 791 bytes of native code.  It has one or
  two variables, so all of them should fix in registers.

## Approximate Benchmark Results

| Benchmark | User Space Time (ms) | Real Time (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| cat | 0 | 46 |
| wc -l | 139 | 189 |
| fgrep | 1,368  | 1,432 |
| grep | 1,093 | 1,133 |
| read:count-lines (touch every byte in C++) | 49 | 186 |
| read:fixed-strings (match with re2c) | 1,211 | 1,347 |
| Python re | 5,781 | 5,946 |

NOTE: Each benchmarks matches the same set of strings, but the output is
slightly different.  I did enough experiments to convince myself that this
doesn't matter.  Aside from I/O, which we've accounted for, **matching** is the
lion's share of the work, not say printing lines.

## Observations

- grep is faster than native code!  I think this is because doesn't touch every
  byte.  It knows how to skip bytes in the fashion of Boyer-Moore.  See links
  below.
- I think that Python is slower because it's a Perl-style **backtracking
  engine** rather than an automata-based angine.
